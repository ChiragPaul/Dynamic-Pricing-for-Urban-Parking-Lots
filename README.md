# Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

**Capstone Project - Summer Analytics 2025**  
_Consulting & Analytics Club √ó Pathway_

## Project Overview

This project implements an intelligent, data-driven dynamic pricing system for urban parking lots. The system processes real-time data streams to adjust parking prices based on demand, competition, and various environmental factors, optimizing utilization while maximizing revenue.

## üéØ Objectives

- Build a real-time dynamic pricing model for 14 parking spaces
- Implement three progressively sophisticated pricing models
- Process streaming data using Pathway framework
- Provide real-time visualizations using Bokeh
- Suggest optimal routing based on competitive analysis

## üìä Dataset Description

### Data Coverage

- **14 parking lots** across urban area
- **73 days** of historical data (reduced to 10 days for demo)
- **18 time points per day** (8:00 AM to 4:30 PM, 30-minute intervals)
- **18,396 total records** in full dataset

### Features

- **Location**: Latitude, Longitude
- **Capacity**: Maximum parking spaces
- **Occupancy**: Current parked vehicles
- **Queue**: Vehicles waiting for entry
- **Traffic**: Nearby traffic congestion level (0-1)
- **Special Day**: Boolean indicator for weekends/holidays
- **Vehicle Type**: Car, bike, or truck

## üß† Pricing Models

### Model 1: Linear Baseline

Simple linear relationship between price and occupancy:

```
Price(t+1) = Price(t) + Œ± √ó (Occupancy/Capacity)
```

### Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

Comprehensive demand function incorporating multiple factors:

```
Demand = Œ±√ó(Occupancy/Capacity) + Œ≤√óQueue - Œ≥√óTraffic + Œ¥√óSpecialDay + Œµ√óVehicleWeight
Price = BasePrice √ó (1 + Œª √ó tanh(Demand/10))
```

**Parameters:**

- Œ± = 5.0 (occupancy sensitivity)
- Œ≤ = 2.0 (queue sensitivity)
- Œ≥ = 1.0 (traffic sensitivity)
- Œ¥ = 3.0 (special day multiplier)
- Œª = 0.5 (demand adjustment factor)

**Vehicle Weights:**

- Car: 1.0
- Bike: -0.5 (discount)
- Truck: 1.5 (premium)

### Model 3: Competitive Pricing

Adds geographical competition and rerouting logic:

- Identifies nearby lots (within ~1km radius)
- Compares prices with competitors
- Suggests rerouting when beneficial
- Applies premium pricing when no cheaper alternatives exist

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Data Generator** (`create_dataset.py`)

   - Generates realistic parking data with temporal patterns
   - Simulates rush hours, weekend effects, and special events
   - Creates correlated occupancy and traffic patterns

2. **Pricing Engine** (`enhanced_model.py`)

   - Implements all three pricing models
   - Handles real-time data processing
   - Manages competitive analysis

3. **Visualization System** (`Dynamic_Parking_Pricing_System.py`)

   - Real-time Bokeh plots
   - Interactive dashboards
   - Comparative analysis charts

4. **Testing Suite** (`simple_test.py`)
   - Model validation
   - Price boundary checking
   - Scenario analysis

## üìà Key Results

### Price Ranges by Scenario

| Scenario              | Average Price | Price Range     | Key Factors      |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| High Occupancy (80%+) | $12.91        | $12.08 - $14.08 | Occupancy, Queue |
| Low Occupancy (<30%)  | $10.85        | $10.06 - $11.39 | Base pricing     |
| High Traffic          | $11.47        | $10.67 - $11.86 | Traffic penalty  |
| Special Days          | $13.12        | $12.47 - $14.08 | Event premium    |

### Model Performance

- **Model 1**: Simple but reactive to occupancy
- **Model 2**: Balanced pricing with smooth variations
- **Model 3**: Intelligent competitive pricing with rerouting

### Competitive Intelligence

- Identifies nearby competitors within 1km radius
- Provides rerouting suggestions when beneficial
- Applies premium pricing when market leader
- Reduces prices when oversupply exists

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Real-Time Processing

- Uses Pathway for streaming data ingestion
- Processes batches with configurable delays
- Maintains price history for trend analysis

### Visualization Features

- Interactive Bokeh plots with hover tooltips
